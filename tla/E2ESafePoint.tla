---- MODULE E2ESafePoint ----
(*
 * Formal specification of the TC18 per-request-stream watchdog and
 * safety-tagged-request execution gate (ROADMAP.md Phase 18, "E2E
 * Protection (Safe Points)", milestone 70; ISO 26262 ASIL-B). Replaces
 * AntiReplayGuard.tla: the retired CRC-16 sequence-counter/replay-window
 * mechanism it modeled has no TC18 counterpart in this codebase --
 * `include/rcp/e2e.h`'s own file header records this explicitly ("this
 * module does not reimplement the pre-replacement content's
 * sequence-counter/replay-window mechanism... the same gap cpp-RCP's and
 * rust-RCP's own merges left open"). What e2e.h implements instead, and
 * what this spec formalizes, is a different pair of safety guarantees:
 * a watchdog-overflow purge that never discards a pending safety-tagged
 * request, and an execution gate that only ever lets a safety-tagged
 * request run once its endpoint has reached its configured safe state.
 *
 * This models one request stream's `rx_wd_enable`/`rx_wd_timeout_ms`/
 * `rx_wd_safestate_enable` watchdog (`rcp_e2e_wd_evaluate()`), its
 * pending-request queue split into a safety-tagged and a normal
 * component (`rcp_e2e_watchdog_purge_should_keep()` /
 * `_classify()`), and the safety-tagged execution admission rule
 * (`rcp_e2e_request_may_execute()`) against a polled
 * `endpoint_in_safe_state` measurement
 * (`rcp_e2e_endpoint_in_safe_state()`). CRC32 well-formedness itself
 * (`rcp_e2e_wrap()`/`_unwrap()`) is a pure per-frame computation with no
 * interesting state-transition behavior to model checking, and is
 * covered by `tests/test_e2e.c` instead.
 *
 * Safety property (SP1): a watchdog-overflow purge with
 * rx_wd_safestate_enable set never discards a pending safety-tagged
 * request -- only normal-tagged requests are purged.
 * Safety property (SP2): a safety-tagged request only ever transitions
 * from pending to executed while its endpoint reports it has reached
 * the configured safe state.
 *
 * Liveness property (LP1, c-RCP-23d / issue #602): a safety-tagged
 * request that becomes pending eventually executes, given per-stream
 * fair scheduling of ExecuteSafety and an endpoint safe-state signal
 * that eventually settles and stays true. issue #602's own suggested
 * wording -- "a pending safety-tagged request is eventually either
 * executed or purged, never stuck pending forever" -- is false by
 * construction against this spec's own SP1 above: Miss(s) (the only
 * purge event) never touches safety_pending by design, so "purged" is
 * never a live alternative for a safety-tagged request, and a property
 * requiring "executed or purged" is unprovable as stated (TLC finds a
 * trivial submit-and-never-purge counterexample). LP1 below is the
 * corrected, narrower claim this spec can actually make and TLC
 * confirms holds. TLC's default no-successor-state deadlock check has
 * already passed on every CI run since this spec was added (predating
 * this issue -- every state in the model has at least one enabled
 * successor). LP1 is a related but strictly stronger claim: per-stream
 * progress/livelock-freedom under fairness, not mere deadlock-freedom.
 * See FORMAL_VERIFICATION.md's "Liveness Properties" section for the
 * fairness-minimality experiment (WF vs. SF, re-run against real TLC)
 * that determined weak fairness is the correct minimum here, not SF.

(* FairSpec adds weak fairness, per stream, on ExecuteSafety(s) -- and

 * rather than assumed (see FORMAL_VERIFICATION.md): nothing in this
 * spec can clear safety_pending[s] except ExecuteSafety(s) itself
 * (Miss(s) leaves it untouched by SP1), so once safety_pending[s] holds
 * and endpoint_in_safe_state[s] holds continuously, ExecuteSafety(s)
 * stays continuously enabled until it is taken -- exactly the condition
 * WF acts on. Strong fairness buys nothing extra here; TLC confirms a
 * WF-only variant already suffices once LP1's antecedent below holds. *)
FairSpec == Spec /\ (\A s \in Streams : WF_vars(ExecuteSafety(s)))

(* LP1's antecedent, per stream: the endpoint's polled safe-state signal
 * eventually settles and stays TRUE. Without this, ObserveSafeState
 * (deliberately left unfair, matching its role as an unconstrained
 * polled environment measurement) could keep flipping
 * endpoint_in_safe_state[s] forever, which would repeatedly disable
 * ExecuteSafety(s) right as it becomes enabled -- WF only acts on an
 * action that is *continuously* enabled, and TLC confirms dropping this
 * antecedent produces exactly that flapping-endpoint counterexample. *)
EndpointEventuallyStable(s) == <>[](endpoint_in_safe_state[s])

(* SP1: a watchdog-overflow purge (safestate-enabled Miss) never clears a
