---- MODULE LifecycleStateMachine ----
(*
 * Formal specification of the TC18 RC Server lifecycle state machine
 * (ROADMAP.md Phase 14, "RC Server lifecycle state machine", milestone
 * 61; ISO 26262 ASIL-B). Replaces WatchdogProtocol.tla and
 * HealthStateMachine.tla, whose Healthy/Degraded/Faulted zone-controller
 * model was retired along with rcp_zone_t/rcp_controller_t (see
 * ROADMAP.md's Protocol Replacement Notice and Satellite Package
 * Disposition table).
 *
 * An RC Server is a single node with exactly one lifecycle state (no
 * per-zone fan-out the way the retired watchdog model had one state per
 * zone -- "redundancy.h/redundancy.c" | DEPRECATE | Built entirely on
 * Controller/Zone; an RC Server is a single node with one lifecycle
 * state"). The three states and the two upward-transition admission
 * gates below are this project's own symbolic names for concepts
 * `include/rcp/lifecycle.h` already implements as
 * `rcp_lifecycle_state_t`/`rcp_lifecycle_transition()`; no spec prose or
 * on-wire numeric constant is reproduced here.
 *
 * Safety property (SP1): the server can never reach RcpConfigured
 * directly from HwUnconfigured -- every upward transition passes through
 * HwConfigured.
 * Safety property (SP2): once a field class is locked while the server
 * is RcpConfigured, it never becomes unlocked again while the server
 * remains RcpConfigured (a lock can only be cleared by demoting all the
 * way back to HwUnconfigured -- a full reset).
 *
 * Liveness property (LP1, c-RCP-23d / issue #602): given HW/RCP
 * configuration inputs that eventually settle and stay consistent, the
 * server eventually reaches RcpConfigured under fair scheduling -- i.e.
 * this is not merely a state the server *can* reach (SP1/SP2 already
 * establish what happens if it does), it is a state fair scheduling
 * *guarantees* it reaches. TLC's default no-successor-state deadlock
 * check has already passed on every CI run since this spec was added
 * (predating this issue -- every state in the model has at least one
 * enabled successor). LP1 is a related but strictly stronger claim:
 * progress/livelock-freedom under fairness, not mere deadlock-freedom.
 * See FORMAL_VERIFICATION.md's "Liveness Properties" section for the
 * fairness-minimality experiment (WF vs. SF, both re-run against real
 * TLC) that determined the fairness conditions below are the correct
 * minimum, not merely a sufficient one chosen out of caution.

(* FairSpec adds the minimum fairness each promote action genuinely
 * needs to guarantee LP1, re-derived and confirmed against real TLC
 * runs rather than assumed (see FORMAL_VERIFICATION.md):
 *
 * - WF_vars(PromoteToHwConfigured): weak fairness suffices. Once
 *   hw_cfg_consistent holds continuously and state = HwUnconfigured
 *   holds continuously, nothing else can disable
 *   PromoteToHwConfigured before it fires -- no other action changes
 *   state away from HwUnconfigured. TLC confirms a WF-only variant
 *   already gets the server past HwUnconfigured on its own.
 *
 * - SF_vars(PromoteToRcpConfigured): strong fairness is required, and
 *   WF is provably insufficient here. DemoteToHwUnconfigured is
 *   unconditionally enabled at state = HwConfigured and can race
 *   PromoteToRcpConfigured back to HwUnconfigured every time before it
 *   fires, so PromoteToRcpConfigured is never *continuously* enabled --
 *   only *infinitely often* enabled -- which WF does not act on but SF
 *   does. TLC confirms a WF-only variant on this action finds a
 *   concrete Promote/Demote lasso counterexample that never leaves
 *   {HwUnconfigured, HwConfigured}.
